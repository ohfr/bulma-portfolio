                <h1>Hi there, my name is Daniel!</h1>
                <p>I'm a software developer located in Vinton, VA. Some of my hobbies include building keyboards, building computers, and writing code of course! I'm a very fun, easy-going individual, in my past jobs I have gained some excellent verbal skills. I have a huge passion for learning, I love tinkering, messing around and finding out how things work. I urge to master so many programming languages just to be able to have fun with building out multiple different types of applications! I'm a very fast learner and don't mind picking up a new stack.</p>
